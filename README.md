# GripLockIoT - A disc golf scorecard application

GripLockIoT is a Disc Golf Scorecard application built for Android. 
The application is for Disc Golf Players to log in their scores while playing disc golf.

Currently the user can create new courses and save them to a local SQLite database.
The aim is to build this into a fairly simplistic Disc Golf Scorecard application with all the essential functionalities (log in a round of disc golf, view past rounds, create / ciew / edit players, create / view / edit courses).
